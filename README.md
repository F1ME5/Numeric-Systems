# Numeric-Systems
A Python programm that receives a number from user. After that, the programm shows all convertions for binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal

Doing all validations from zero is pretty difficult so I used regular expresions (RegEx in Python) to define my rules that help me to make the work easier.
You'll see simple functions that check the especific numeric system rule and print the values. I tried to write this code as the cleanest way possible so I hope you understand each line of the programm.

That's all. I hope you like my work, feel free to ask anything you want and use this program as you want.
